# CEG3136A – Lab1: Mixed C & ASM Project

## Introduction
Welcome to the GitHub repository for the completion of Lab1 in CEG3136A. In this lab assignment, I have successfully implemented a battle ship game using a mix of C and assembly language. The game is designed as a one-player game against the computer, where the player attempts to destroy all enemy ships on the battlefield.

## Overview
- **Objective:** Implement a battle ship game using a combination of C and assembly language.
- **Language Used:** C, Assembly Language
- **Lab Completion Date:** [Insert Completion Date]

## Lab Completion Summary
- **Implemented Features:**
  - Developed an OO design for the battle ship game.
  - Utilized function pointers and OOP concepts in C to manage player functionality.
  - Implemented assembly language versions of key player functions for performance optimization.
- **Tested Functionality:**
  - Tested the game functionality to ensure proper interaction between C and assembly language components.
  - Verified the correct behavior of player functions in both C and assembly language.

## Project Structure
- **Source Code:** Contains the source code files for both C and assembly language implementations.
- **µVision Project:** The µVision project file containing all project configurations.

## Instructions for Running the Project
1. Download the provided µVision project.
2. Compile and run the project code.
3. Ensure proper functionality by testing game features and interactions.
4. Compare the behavior of player functions implemented in both C and assembly language.
5. Debug any issues and optimize assembly language functions for performance if necessary.

## Repository Contents
- **Lab1_Code:** Contains the source code files for the battle ship game implementation.
- **Lab1_Project.uvprojx:** The µVision project file.
